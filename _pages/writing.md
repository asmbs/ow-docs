The **ObesityWeek** edition of WordPress offers several tools to help you write content quickly and easily. The standard WYSIWYG editor has been replaced with a [Markdown editor][p--markdown], so you can write in plain text and add simple formatting without any code. There are also several [shortcodes][p--shortcodes] available that help you control how your content is displayed, again without requiring any HTML code.
